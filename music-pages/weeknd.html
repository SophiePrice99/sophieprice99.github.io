      <p>It has been 4 years since The Weeknd released 'Starboy', so fans have been waiting a long time for this album.</p>

      <p>Lead single Blinding Lights is an incredible fusion of 80s pop and techno. Although it gained popularity through TikTok, the track was no. 1 in the UK for eight weeks. The Weeknd teases the listener by making them listen to nearly 25 minutes of other tracks before this banger is showcased.</p>

      <p>Sadly, the track Alone Again resonates with thousands of self-isolators around the globe in this difficult time. Even The Weeknd's voice sounds hollow, and you can sense the pain that we are all inevitably feeling.</p>

      <p>But, this is The Weeknd. The track Heartless still promotes moments of misogny and unnecessary sex. I mean, it's getting a bit boring now.</p>

      <p>However, this whole album is a work of art. The songs seemlessly roll into each other and takes the listener on an emotional journey with them. The Weeknd tells an incredible story through all 14 tracks, ending on a rather bitter and sudden note with Until I Bleed Out. I wonder how they will pick up from this unhappy ending with their next work?</p>
