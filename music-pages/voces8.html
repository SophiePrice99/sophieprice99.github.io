    <p>This is a really hard album for me to review as my first. I love Voces8. Any novice choral singer does. Fact. (Well, I thought, until I listened to Enchated Isle).</p>
    
    <p>For me, this album is almost like Voces8 mid-life crisis. Trying to attract a wide-ranging audience, and bridge the classical-popular divide, it is a collision of British and Irish folk songs, a tune taken from Lord of the Rings and a couple of easy listening tunes (featuring Radiohead, don't ask)... But they kind of all sound the same. Kinda sweet, kinda boring.</p>

    <p>I love Voces8 because of the clarity of their tracks. The collaboration between the group. And the tantalising high notes - which I regularly try to recreate in the shower. But this album takes it too far, and sounds like a fake, over-produced selection of music (or, rather a medley) that could have been recorded by anyone, anywhere.</p>

    <p>This is such a shame, especially as it was Eleanore Cockerham's first album, as a new soprano, with the group.</p>

    <p>But, you should still listen to 'Carrickfergus' no matter how auto-tuned and over-produced the rest of this album may be. Guest singer, Sibeal, has a magical quality to her voice and never fails to tell a story through her performance. Luckily, her highly ornamented melody and rich tone to her voice aren't masked by a range of studio effects, unlike the rest of the album. </p>

    <p>Bring back the Lux and Eventide vibe please Voces8.</p>
