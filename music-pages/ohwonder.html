    <p>We have been waiting since 2017 for a new Oh Wonder Album since 'Ultralife' and THANK THE LORD IT HAS COME.</p>

    <p>This album is a massive celebration for electric-pop music. I was so lucky to see Oh Wonder on their world tour in Bristol this year and that really cemented how clever this album is. </p>

    <p>The beautiful romantic journey between Josephine and Anthony really comes to light in this album.</p>

    <p>'How It Goes' provides a message so important for society right now: it is okay to not feel okay all the time. This is a surprising dark horse on the album. The beautiful vocals are blended with some awesome, funky jazz riffs, taking some heavy inspiriation from Craig David.</p>
    
    <p>There are some fantastic ballards that blast positive messages out, including 'Hallelujah' and 'Dust' which truly empower the listener. 'Hallelujah' is a piece of musical magic. The vocals fill the room, as if a 50-strong choir was in your living room, and the texture provided by strings highlights how amazing this duo are at music writing.</p>

    <p>The acoustic versions of their tracks at the end of the album are also worth listening too. Joesphine's voice is like velvet and her and Anthony work so well together in these.</p>

    <p>This stylish, sublime album showcases what Oh Wonder does best. The album is full of high-quality tracks, which cover a range of moods and emotions, but don't deviate from what they do so well - produce and write excellent music. I hope that this fab duo continue to go from strength to stregth. I do just worry that their next album may be too repetitive. But let's watch this space. </p>
