    <p>Arlo Parks is definitely one to watch. Known for her single 'Cola', she was predicted by the BBC as a breakthrough act of 2020.</p>

    <p>This article is begging you to go and listen to her lastest two tracks, released during lockdown: 'Eugene' and 'Black Dog'.</p>

    <p>Named after Churchill's metaphor for the illness, 'Black Dog' is a heart-breakingly honest portrait of trying to help your friends through depression. People are stuck inside isolating and naturally, feeling low. Quarantine is difficult. Parks hopes this song will help people through this period of lockdown.</p>

    <p>'Eugene' covers another difficult topic, often neglated in society: when the lines between platonic and romantic love blur. Parks opens up to her audience, and shows her weaknesses and vulnerabilities, almost like we are reading an illicit diary entry. If you love Loyle Carner, you'll love this too. Honest lyrics, catchy backbeats and ambient melodic beats. </p>
