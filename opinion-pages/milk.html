  <h3>More and more people are deciding to ditch the dairy. So here is my alternative guide to the most common plant-based milks on the market. </h3>

  <p class = "date">24/06/2020</p>

  <table>
    <tr>
        <th><h1 class="h1">Soy Milk</h1></th>
        <th><img class = "Images" src="../img/soymilk.jpeg"></th>
        <th><p>Soy milk is probably the most readily available alternative milk at cafes. Soy milk is either made with soybeans or soy protein. </p>
          <p>With regards to nutrition, soy milk is said to be one of the best non-dairy milk alternatives. It contains a similar amount of protein per glass, but half the number of calories, fats and carbs.</p>
          <p>Doesn't do great in hot drinks, but still a good alternative.</p>
      </th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th><h1 class="h1">Almond Milk</h1></th>
        <th><img class = "Images" src="../img/almondmilk.jpg"></th>
        <th><p>Almond milk is another popular alternative. With a slightly sweet and nutty flavour, it is great for plant-based cooking, milkshakes and smoothies. Most almond milk only contains 1-2% of almonds, so it is quite watery.</p>
            <p>High in vitamins and calcium, but not very high in protein. It also doesn't fair very well in hot drinks. </p>
      </th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th><h1 class="h1">Coconut Milk</h1></th>
        <th><img class = "Images" src="../img/coconutmilk.jpg"></th>
        <th><p>Coconut milk is really versatile - drinking, cooking... you name it. Personally, I love coconut milk in ice coffee and in milkshakes.</p>
            <p>It is one of the healthiest alternative milks on the market. It is full of healthy fat, vitamins, minerals and amino acids.</p>
            <p>However, it is higher in calories than other plant-based milks, and doesn't provide nearly as much protein as dairy milk.</p>
      </th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th><h1 class="h1">Oat Milk</h1></th>
        <th><img class = "Images" src="../img/oatly.jpg"></th>
        <th><p>OATLY. The King of Alternative Milk in my opinion. </p>
            <p>Highly nutritious, high calcium, protein and carb intake - so great to add to shakes after the gym or a workout.</p>
            <p>Creamy, naturally sweet, mild and therefore brilliant in hot drinks - Oatly even has a barista range. Their barista milk is made from liquid oats, which means that the milk is not excessively heavy or chalky. It froths really well. </p>
            <p>My go to order: Oat Flat White. Heaven.</p>
      </th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th><h1 class="h1">Rice Milk</h1></th>
        <th><img class = "Images" src="../img/ricemilk.jpg"></th>
        <th><p>If you're looking for a milk alternative similar to skimmed milk, rice milk is probably the best for you.</p>
            <p>Made by combining milled white or brown rice with water, rice milk has a light and sweet flavour with a delicate texture. It is popular to add to hot drinks because it barely affects the taste of coffee. </p>
            <p>Rice milk is the least allergenic of alternative milks, making it suitable for those with allergies and intolerances to gluten, soy, nuts and dairy.</p>
