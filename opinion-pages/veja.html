    <p>I have recently decided, that fashion must to meet two goals for me: firstly, to make me feel and (hopefully!) look fab, but more importantly, to make the fashion industry a better place.</p>

    <p>Depop and charity shops are all great, and I use them a lot in my effort to 'slow' fashion down. But I recently wanted to treat myself to a new pair of white, staple trainers. I did look around on second-hand websites, but wasn't truly inspired. Then, I came across Veja.</p>

    <p>Veja. Where does this name come from? No, nothing to do with vegans or vegetarians, as I hear you all sigh. In Portugese, "veja" means "look". The founders of Veja, Sebastien Kopp & François-Ghislain Morillion, had the idea of looking through your sneakers. What is behind them? The processes, the manufacturing, the labour, the design, the contracts, the fabrics... </p>

    <p>From rubber to mesh, every fabric used in Veja trainers comes from Brazil and is reused or recycled. This ranges from plastic bottles to previously used cotton and polyester. Some of their trainers do use leather, but they ensure that they know where it comes from. Veja's leather comes from a Brazilian factory that follows a strict non-toxic protocol. Veja also offers a vegan leather alternative. A lot of vegan leathers on the market actually use more waste than normal leather. Therefore, Veja is unique in making sure that their alternative creates less waste and lasts longer than other vegan leathers on the market. Veja opts for corn waste for this sustainable leather alternative which is truly innovative. </p>
        
    <p>Social sustainability is just as important as environmental sustainability for Veja. In 2009, Veja entrusted its logistics to Ateliers Sans Frontières, a job reintegration workshop. Their mission is to fight social exclusion through labour.</p>

    <p>Veja are a truly transparent brand. They happily make it public knowledge how much Veja factory employees earn, to how they produce cotton and the limits to their trainers. For example, in manufacturing, Veja openly share that they eyelets in their trainers don't contain nickel but are made of metal that they haven't sourced themselves. Boldly, Veja also dares their customers to ask themselves questions regarding overconsumption. Do we really need to buy so many pairs of shoes? It is necessary to fetishize trainers in such a way? Do we always need to own the latest style? Veja are so proud of their produce, but also ask these important questions. Incredible. </p>
    
    <p>Now to my review. Honestly, it did take a a few wears of these trainers in order for them to break in. No blisters or anything, just a bit of rubbing. The tongue of the trainer did annoy me at first, but now they are like slippers. So persevere for a week or two, but then you will be fine!</p>

    <p>Style. I love these trainers. There are so many different colours and styles you can buy. I went for a classic combination, as they were going to be an everday staple for my wardrobe. But, if you fancy something a bit funkier, there will definitely be something for you!</p>

    <p>So, here we come to discuss the price. My V-12 trainers were £115. For a decent pair of sustainable, good quality trainers, I do not think that this is unreasonable. Especially, as other well known trainer brands such as Nike and Adidas will charge a similar amount for sweatshop sneakers. But, Veja do rely on us to spread the word. Veja is based on a very simple observation: 70% of the cost of a normal big sneaker brand is related to advertising. Consequently, eliminating ads, marketing costs, doing away with brand ambassadors, billboards, means investing in reality rather than fiction. It costs 5 to 7 times more to make a Veja than other trainers, because the raw materials are environmentally friendly and purchased according to fairtrade principles, because the sneakers are produced in factories with high social standards. Since Veja have elimated all these additional costs, they are able to sell their products for the same price as competing big brands. Hurray! Let's support the collective intelligence Veja relies on in order to continue its fight against fast fashion.</p>
