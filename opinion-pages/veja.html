    <p>Veja make their trainers out of reused and recycled fabrics. This ranges from plastic bottles to previously used cotton and polyester. Some of their trainers do use leather, but they ensure that they know where it comes from. Veja's leather comes from a Brazilian factory that follows a strict non-toxic protocol. Veja also offers a vegan leather alternative. A lot of vegan leathers on the market actually use more waste than normal leather. Therefore, Veja is unique in making sure that their alternative creates less waste and lasts longer than other vegan leathers on the market. Veja opts for corn waste for this sustainable leather alternative which is truly innovative. </p>

    <p>Honestly, it did take a a few wears of these trainers in order for them to break in. No blisters or anything, just a bit of rubbing. The tongue of the trainer did annoy me at first, but now they are like slippers. So persevere for a week or two, but then you will be fine!</p>

    <p>So, here we come to discuss the price. My V-12 trainers were Â£115. For a decent pair of sustainable, good quality trainers, I do not think that this is unreasonable. Especially, as other well known trainer brands such as Nike and Adidas will charge a similar amount for sweatshop sneakers.</p>
