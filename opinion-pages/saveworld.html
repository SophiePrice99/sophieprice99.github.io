    <p>The amazing Natalie Fee makes an incredibly important contribution to the climate change debate in a quirky, light-hearted way. She provides life-altering opportunities in all areas of our lives, from what we eat and drink, to where we bank, how we travel and most surprisingly, how to have eco-friendly sex. She forces us to think more differently about our daily activities and what their impact on the environment are.</p>
    <p>If you love love love our environment like me, you will probably shed a tear at the end of the book in the knowledge that there are so many small changes that we can easily make (for free!) in order to save our world.</p>
    <p>I would have quite liked the advice to be more accessible. Natalie Fee focuses on offering the UK and USA advice, which granted, is necessary, but in order to maximise the impact of the environmental movement, the advice and solutions offered should have targetted a wider audience.</p>
    <p>Finally, I greatly appreciate the fact that Natalie Fee attempts to include everyone in this debate, such as using trans-inclusive language when referring to periods and appreciating that straws can often be an essential item for disabled people. However, there is still an ableist, vegan, middle-class underlying tone, which at times seems to promote buying more stuff to replace other less-ethical stuff. Isn't consummerism one of the key issues at heart here? </p>
    <p>But hey ho, it is still an informative guide which succinctly sums up the growing problem of climate change and how we can save the planet for free. Natalie Fee also includes a list of resources at the end of the book to encourage her readers to continue educating themselves about this important topic.</p>
