    <p>Hi, I'm Sophie, a final year BSc Geography Student at the University of Bristol. Outside of term-time, or during a pandemic... I live in a small town in the Cotswolds between Oxford and Cheltenham.</p>
    
    <p>I decided to create this website mid-pandemic, in order to learn a new coding language and to quench my passion to learn! I have extensively used the coding programme R in my degree and for my dissertation at Bristol, but I kinda fancied a change!</p>
     
    <p>I have been learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript with Code First Girls on their Website Development course which I am absolutely loving. Code First Girls are a company dedicated to transforming the technology industry. The company provides a range of skills, knowledge and inspiration in order to aid women in becoming developers and future leaders in the industry. </p>
      
    <p>Alongside coding, I love to create music. I sing in the University of Bristol Chamber Choir. We rehearse every Monday evening. I am the Choir's manager next year. This role involves organising the music, taking attendance at each rehearsal and planning concerts. Alongisde singing, I enjoy playing the piano. I achieved a distinction in my grade 8 piano exam when I was 16. I still enjoy to play now in my free time. I am also a private music tutor in Bristol and the Cotswolds. I teach music theory and the piano, with the goal for my pupils to successfully pass ABRSM exams with high marks.</p>
    
    <p>I also enjoy horse riding with the University of Bristol Riding Club every week. I have been the Club's Secretary for two years. This role invovles organising weekly lessons, planning beach rides and running the social media accounts on behalf of the Club. I am also running to be the Club's Vice President for next year.</p>
    
    <p>I have a strong interest in law and hope to become a future solicitor. I'm a Future Vacation Scheme Student in the Cheltenham Office for Charles Russell Speechlys, due to begin in June 2020. To continue my journey in pursuing a legal career, I have accepted an offer to study the PGDL at BPP Bristol commencing in September 2020. Following this, I hope to secure a training contract before I begin the LPC.</p>
    
    <p>I hope you find this website enjoyable in some form - whether it is laughing at my amateur coding attempt or any of my content! Feel free to say hello using the form on my homepage or message me on any of my social media accounts linked above. I would love to hear from you. </p>
